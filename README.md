- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @saschaleib
- ðŸ‘€ I'm working on web sites and office automation for an international organisation. My specialities are (web) accessibility and typography.
- ðŸŒ± Special interests at the moment are home automation (Home Assistant) and formal logic (especially fallacies), for which I even have a (German-language) wiki at https://denkfehler.online/ and a (much smaller) English version at https://fallacies.online/ 
- ðŸš§ My main project here is the DokuWiki template that I created for these sites: [dokuwiki-template-ad-hominem](https://github.com/saschaleib/dokuwiki-template-ad-hominem) and the new, experimental  [dokuwiki-template-nuropa](https://github.com/saschaleib/dokuwiki-template-nuropa) template (WIP)
